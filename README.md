     Download and run the installer from [ollama.com/download/windows](https://ollama.com/download/windows).

2. **Start Ollama**:
   Launch Ollama from your Start Menu. A llama icon will appear in your Windows System Tray (near the clock).

3. **Pull the Default Models**:
   Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:
   ```powershell
   ollama pull moondream
   ollama pull gemma4:e2b
   ```

---

### 🍏 macOS Setup (Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3/M4 & Intel)

1. **Install Ollama**:
   - **Option A (Homebrew)**:
     ```bash
     brew install --cask ollama
     ```
   - **Option B (Direct Download)**:
     Download the `.zip` from [ollama.com/download/mac](https://ollama.com/download/mac) and drag `Ollama.app` into `/Applications`.

2. **Start Ollama**:
   Launch **Ollama** from Applications or Spotlight. An Ollama menu bar icon will appear at the top of your screen.

3. **Pull the Default Models**:
   Open Terminal and run:
   ```bash
   ollama pull moondream
   ollama pull gemma4:e2b
   ```

---

### ✅ Verify Ollama Installation

To confirm both models are ready, run:
```bash
ollama list
```
You should see `moondream:latest` and `gemma4:e2b` listed.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10–3.12** (3.13+ is not yet supported by all dependencies such as `torch` and `zvec`)
- **Ollama** installed and running (see [Ollama Setup Guide](#-ollama-setup-guide-end-to-end) above)
- **macOS only**: Xcode Command Line Tools are required to compile native Python packages:
  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```
  > **Note**: If `pillow-heif` fails to install (needed for HEIC/HEIF photo support), install the system library:
  > ```bash
  > brew install libheif
  > ```
- **Linux only**: OpenCV requires system libraries on headless setups:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install -y libgl1-mesa-glx libglib2.0-0
  ```

---

## ⚡ Frictionless Installation

### 🪟 Windows Quick Start

Voxlery provides automated setup scripts that configure the Python virtual environment and check your tools:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/xklabs-AI/Voxlery.git
   cd Voxlery
   ```

2. **Run the automated setup**:
   Double-click `setup.bat` or run in PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   .\setup.bat
   ```
   *(Or using PowerShell: `.\setup.ps1`)*

   > **Zero-Friction Tip**: If you simply run `.\launch.bat` on a fresh system, it will automatically detect that setup is needed and configure `.venv` for you!

---

### 🍏 macOS & Linux Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xklabs-AI/Voxlery.git
   cd Voxlery
   ```

2. **Run the automated setup**:

## 🚀 Running Voxlery

Voxlery can run either as a **Native Desktop Application** or as a **Local Web Platform**.

### Option 1: Native Desktop Application (Tauri v2)

The desktop mode provides native OS window dragging, glass styling, and native file dialogs:

- **Windows**:
  ```powershell
  .\launch.bat --desktop
  # or: .\launch.ps1 -desktop
  ```
- **macOS / Linux**:
  ```bash
  ./launch.sh --desktop
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> **Desktop Mode Prerequisites**:
> Desktop mode requires **Rust/Cargo** and **Node.js 18+**. Install Rust via:
> ```bash
> curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
> source ~/.cargo/env
> ```
> On Windows, Microsoft C++ Build Tools are also required. Then install frontend dependencies:
> ```bash
> npm install
> ```
> If Rust is not present, Voxlery will inform you and gracefully offer to run in Web Browser Mode.

> [!WARNING]
> **macOS 27+ SDK Compatibility**: The macOS 27.0 SDK introduces new architecture identifiers (`arm64e.x1`) that the current stable Rust toolchain does not yet recognize. If the desktop build fails with linker errors referencing `unknown architecture`, use **Web Browser Mode** (`./launch.sh`) as a fully functional alternative until Rust ships an updated toolchain.

---

### Option 2: Web Browser Platform (FastAPI)

Runs the high-speed local server and automatically opens your default web browser:

- **Windows**:
  ```powershell
  .\launch.bat
  ```
- **macOS / Linux**:
  ```bash
  ./launch.sh
  ```

Default URL: 👉 **`http://localhost:8642`**

---

### Option 3: Quick Demo Archive (12 Sample Photos)

Want to try Voxlery instantly without waiting for your photo library to index?
- **Windows**:
  ```powershell
  .\launch.bat --demo
  ```
- **macOS / Linux**:
  ```bash
  ./launch.sh --demo
  ```
This seeds 12 curated memories (landscapes, birthdays, pets, food, travel) with GPS and embeddings in ~2 seconds so you can test natural language search right away!
